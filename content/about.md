# About

OnionTree is an open source repository of Tor hidden services. We aim to provide up-to-date, curated index of the most popular dark web services, and be as transparent about it as technology allows it.

We want access to the data to be easy for humans and machines alike. All data is stored in _YAML_ files. *YAML* can be easily read and written by both. The data is also available in _JSON_ via [API](/api.html).

The data is released in public domain and a software is licensed as a free software. We hope that open access will fuel novel ideas.

This website is [generated](https://github.com/oniontree-org/oniontree-hugo) from data in the repository and is served by a web server. Use only the mirrors listed in [/mirrors.txt](/mirrors.txt). All other websites claiming to be OnionTree are fake.

## How it works?

New data is discovered by traversing [Darknet Live](/services/darknetlive.html), [Dread](/services/dread.html), [dark.fail](/services/darkfail.html) and dark web [forums](/tags/forum.html), or by user submitted contributions via [GitHub](https://github.com/onionltd/oniontree).

All contributions are stored in a _Git_ repository and must be _PGP_ signed. Entire history of a file, including all changes is recorded and therefore publicly auditable.

Services which support [Onion Mirror Guidelines](https://github.com/onionltd/go-omg/blob/master/spec.txt) are [updated automatically](https://github.com/oniontree-org/service-mirrors-sync).

[SecureDrop](/tags/securedrop.html) instances are [scraped](https://github.com/oniontree-org/securedrop-instances-sync) from the official SecureDrop directory API.

[Invidious](/services/invidious.html) instances are [scraped](https://github.com/oniontree-org/invidious-instances-sync) from the official Invidious API.
